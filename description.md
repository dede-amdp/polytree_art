Can you mend what is broken?
Can you find hope in crisis?
Can you give life to something dead?
When nothing else matters, why would you dream? Why would you go anywhere?

Maybe it's no use looking for something that might not exist but it may be the best way to find something unexpected, hopefully good.

✨ Hi guys, new post! ✨ This time the inspiration comes from a simple concept: "dividi et impera"...
So in one of the previous posts I've used a Quadtree data structure to optimize the performances of the algorithm (the flock one): it is based on the use of rectangles to subdivide the space (or parallelepipeds in 3D) and decrease the number of objects to check for each frame. While thinking about random stuff an idea sprouted: what if the shape was not a rectangle, but any other polygon? So here there is the result, here you can see regular shapes but actually any polygon can be represented and I might get back to this work to explore what happens when you use it with strange shapes, like cats for example...
